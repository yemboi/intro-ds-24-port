# intro-ds-24-port
My submission for the portfolio assesment(element 1) 

I have collated 4 entries for my portfolio for the Introduction to Data Science module. Each entry is a notebook with a supporting word document which explains the code and provides references for the notebook.

The code files are all ipynb files(jupyter notebooks)
